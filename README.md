# simple_pid_controller_design
This project shows an hand-on example for creating an PID controller.

- Bode Plot data is stored within `measured_frequency_response_of_the_plant.txt`
- Via the matlab-script `plant_estimation_and_controller_design.m` the transfer function of the given bode-plot can be estimated. Furthermore, the corresponding controller parameters are calculated.
-With `LTspice_controller_implementation.asc` the simulation of the closed system can be started.
